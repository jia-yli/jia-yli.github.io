<h3 class="card-title"><span class="font-weight-bold">In Short</span></h3>
This new rounding unit supports the five existing RISC-V rounding modes and stochastic rounding extension. It has transprecision capability and supports different floating-point formats from FP64 to custom FP8. This new rounding unit has been integrated into floating-point unit [FPnew](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvfpu/blob/feature/expanding_dotp/src/fpnew_rounding.sv) in the PULP project as an extension for the RISC-V FP specification. This project is carried out at [IIS, ETH](https://iis.ee.ethz.ch/).
