I did a 6-month full-time internship at Huawei Zürich Research Center and was working on their Da Vinci Architecture. With custom designed hardware components and software operators, leveraging the sparsity in the workload, I demonstrated upto 7x acceleration for convolution operators in EfficientDet on MOT17 task, and up to 10% acceleration for the matrix-matrix multiplication operator for a internal recommender model without any precision loss.
