I am doing my Master’s in <a href='https://master-qe.ethz.ch/'>MSc Quantum Engineering</a> at D-ITET(Electrical Engineering Department), ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland. I did some projects in [Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning and System Tasks]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }})(both ASIC and FPGA, including one tapeout), [Event-based Cameras]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }})(PCB and software, including image stitching and object detection algorithm), and [Virtual Reality]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }})(dynamic mesh mendering from neural implicit representations).

Before this, I did my bachelor’s in Physics at Peking University, Beijing, China. I did some projects in [Topological Photonics]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }})(simulation on bound states in the continuum and polarization vortices).

Follow [this link]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) to see the details of those projects and related publications.
